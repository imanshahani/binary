Upon the shrub thorns he asked us to call. Upon the blockcade we call the Priest of the Blockade. Upon the thick shrubbery  thorns we call, to Heaven calmly ascend. Holy Spirit descend. The Peace of the Holy Spirit said; 'I have nowhere to descend.' I find the front filled with thorns, I find the rear and the middle filled with thorns. The humans appealed to the Spirit of Destiny to pray to the Great Spirit of Manifestation. Holy Spirit descend. Remove the thorns front the front and rear. Holy Spirit descend. Remove the thorns fro m the middle. Holy Spirit descend. At the front place of Peace, the Holy Spirit becomes manifest. At the rear place of Peace, the Holy Spirit becomes manifest. At the middle place of Peace, the Holy Spirit becomes manifest. May it be so."
