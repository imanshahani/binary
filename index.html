&nbsp;Binary systems feel natural to human interpretation of the world.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The universe presents many apparent and true opposites.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Humans naturally describe the world using opposing pairs like light-dark, hot-cold, and good-bad.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Consequently, many cultures have independently developed binary systems for their own purposes.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Prominent historical examples include Geomancy from the medieval Muslim world and I-Ching from ancient China.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Both I-Ching and Geomancy are binary systems used to interpret and predict outcomes from random processes.<br><br>I-Ching<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The I-Ching is a 6-bit binary system from ancient China.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The system uses chance actions, like coin flips, to determine a sequence of two opposing states, creating a binary string.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The I-Ching assigns a unique identity and interpretation to each of its 64 possible outcomes, known as hexagrams.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These 64 6-bit hexagrams can be broken down into combinations of 8 possible 3-bit trigrams.<br><br>Geomancy<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Geomancy is a 4-bit binary system from the medieval Muslim world.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The process begins by creating 16 lines of random dots while considering a specific question.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Each line is interpreted as even (0) or odd (1) based on its dot count.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These 16 bits are arranged into four 4-bit groups called the \"mothers.\"<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Four \"daughters\" are derived by transposing the bits of the \"mothers.\"<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Four \"nieces\" are created by performing a binary XOR operation on pairs of \"mothers\" and \"daughters.\"<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Two \"witnesses\" are created by performing an XOR operation on pairs of \"nieces.\"<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A final \"judge\" is created by performing an XOR operation on the two \"witnesses\" and is used to interpret the matter.<br><br>Ifá<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Ifá is a 16-bit binary system from the Yoruba culture in western Africa.<br>*&nbsp;\n &nbsp;The 16 bits are determined either by casting a divining chain or by \nrepeatedly taking nuts from a pile and noting the remainder.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The resulting 16-bit string is used to find appropriate prayers and answers within the ritual.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These historical systems are all methods for breaking down the chaos of chance into a finite set of possibilities.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;By assigning meaning to these possibilities, people derive guidance and spiritual comfort.<br><br>Binary Fractals<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A binary fractal is a bitmap where white represents 1 and black represents 0.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This 2D bitmap is generated from a single 1-dimensional binary string.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The base pattern of the 1D string is encoded throughout the entire bitmap.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, the first row of the fractal for 4 (100) is 1-0-0.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The first row of the bitmap is identical to the first column.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Each subsequent row is either the original base string or its binary complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The determination of whether a row is the original or its complement depends on the corresponding bit in the first column.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The resulting 3x3 bitmap for 4 (100) consists of rows 1-0-0, 0-1-1, and 0-1-1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The \"fractal\" aspect arises from tiling the base bitmap 2x2 and overlaying a 2x scaled copy using boolean operations.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This process of tiling, scaling, and overlaying can be repeated infinitely to create higher \"orders\" of complexity.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The base bitmap with no self-interference is called a \"first-order\" binary fractal.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Further complexity is created when a different binary string interferes with the base fractal.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Interference patterns can also be generated by rotating two fractals as they overlay.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These rotational interferences create \"zones\" of repeating patterns whose size depends on the angle.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;An angle of 180/π degrees produces a zone that is 1 pixel wide.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The required angle for a specific zone size is (180/π) divided by the desired size.<br><br>Projection onto a \"Bipolar\" Sphere<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The first-order fractal patterns have a unique topology.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The top-left corner acts as one pole, and the bottom-right corner acts as the opposite pole.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The top-left pole radiates the base pattern horizontally and vertically.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The bottom-right pole radiates the reverse of the base string's complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The fractal inherently encodes the base string, its complement, its reverse, and its reverse-complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation transforms the base string into its complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A 90-degree clockwise rotation transforms the base string into its reverse.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A 180-degree rotation transforms the base string into its reverse-complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The diagonal lines of the fractal can be mapped as \"latitude bands\" on a sphere.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The number of diagonal latitude bands is equal to (2 · width) - 1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This method allows a 1D string to be projected as information onto a 2D spherical surface.<br><br>Binary Taxonomy (The Four Number Types)<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Integers and their corresponding fractals can be classified into distinct types based on their binary symmetry.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The primary categories are Monolateral, Bilateral, and Quadrilateral.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A number is Monolateral if its binary form is a palindrome, and all Monolaterals are odd.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Odd Bilateral category includes all odd numbers that are not palindromes.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Odd Bilateral numbers always exist in pairs, where one is the exact binary reverse of the other.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Even Bilateral numbers are generated by the Reverse Complement Concatenation (RCC) operation.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The RCC formula is N = S1 + ¬(~ S1), where S1 is a k-bit string and + is concatenation.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Even Bilateral numbers produced by RCC always have an even bit-length (2k).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Quadrilateral category contains all numbers that are not Monolateral or Bilateral.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;All Quadrilateral numbers are even.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A \"trilateral\" type is impossible in this system due to the inherent symmetries of the square bitmap.<br><br>The \"Binary Grammar\" (The Toolbox)<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A \"Binary Grammar\" describes the generation of these number types through a set of operations on a binary string `S`.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The three core Actions are: Replace (`→`), Append (`+`), and Prepend (`+`).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The three core Operations are: Identity (`I`), Invert (`¬`), and Reverse (`~`).<br>*&nbsp;\n &nbsp;The notation `[OPERATION] S + [OPERATION] S` defines the sequence, \nwhere the left side is prepended and the right side is appended.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Reverse-Replace operation `S → ~ S` defines the pairing rule for Odd Bilaterals.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Reverse-Append `S + ~ S` and Reverse-Prepend `~ S + S` operations are generators for Monolaterals.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Identity-Append operation `S + I S` generates \"Tandem Palindromes,\" a sub-class of Even Bilaterals.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Invert-Append operation `S + ¬ S` generates \"Contra-Palindromes,\" another sub-class of Even Bilaterals.<br><br>Population Dynamics (The Ecology)<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Population dynamics describe the distribution and first appearance of these number types across the number line.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Specific equations describe the proportion (percentage) of each type as the sample size (x) increases.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of Quadrilaterals is given by P_q(x) = C - (A / x^D) · cos(π · log₂(x)).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of Bilaterals is given by P_b(x) = C + (A / x^D) · cos(π · log₂(x)).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of Monolaterals is P_m(x) = 100 - (P_q(x) + P_b(x)).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportions of Bilaterals and Quadrilaterals converge at even powers of two (4, 16, 64).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;They reach maximum divergence at odd powers of two (8, 32, 128).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;As the sample size approaches infinity, the proportions of Monolaterals and Even Bilaterals approach 0%.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;As the sample size approaches infinity, Odd Bilaterals and Quadrilaterals each approach 50% of the total population.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Lag\" equations describe the gap after a power of two (2^k) before the first new number of a specific type appears.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The lag for the first Monolateral (Standard Palindrome) after 2^k is always 1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The lag for the first Even Bilateral (RCC number) in a 2k-bit range is 2^k - 2.<br><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>\n <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>\n  <o:RelyOnVML/>\n  <o:AllowPNG/>\n

systems are natural to human interpretation of the world around us. The
universe is filled, to the brim, with both apparent and true opposites. Through
observation, human beings have naturally come to describe the world in terms of
opposites: light-dark, hot-cold, big-small, far-near, good-bad, pleasure-pain,
day-night, summer-winter, future-past, and the list is seemingly endless. It is
thus no surprise that numerous cultures around the world have innovated the use
of binary for their own purposes. The most prominent among these would be
Geomancy from the medieval Muslim world, and I-Ching from ancient China. Both
are binary systems that are used to interpret and to predict outcomes from
chance or chaos. Although these cultures did not necessarily view these systems
as binary or computational, they can nevertheless be understood as such from
our perspective in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</div></div><div class="editable-wrapper" id="b-1764284791765">

it, two opposing states are determined from actions of chance such as flipping
coins, in sequence, to create a binary string. As there are a finite number of
outcomes, the I-Ching has a specific identity and interpretation for every

is a 4-bit binary system that originates in the medieval pre-Islamic Arab world. 16 lines
of random dots are made while a matter in question is described. Then the 16
lines are interpreted as even (0, or two dots) or odd (1, or one dot) based on
the number of dots per line. This gives 16 derived bits, which are then
distributed to four groups that constitute “mothers”. Then four “daughters” are
derived from a transposition of the first, second, third, and fourth bits of
the mothers. Then a binary XOR operation is done on the pairs of mothers and
pairs of daughters to create four “nieces”. Then a binary XOR operation is done
on the pairs of nieces to create two “witnesses”. Lastly the pair of witnesses
undergo one last binary XOR operation to create a final “judge” that is used to
interpret matters. Click&nbsp;<a href="tools/geomancy.html" target="_blank">[here]</a>&nbsp;to use my Geomancy simulator and explore it for

the convex or concave side of a nut is interpreted as odd or even, or a person
is to try to swipe a pile of nuts from one hand to another 16 times -- with the
remainder per swipe determining the quality of each bit. Once all 16 bits are

many of these binary-based systems existed in the past, it was not until
 the work of 17th century polymath, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, that 
binary was formalized as a mathematical system. His work is where binary
 notation with zeros and ones originates from. Of course, using zeros 
and ones to represent base-2 is not a crazy leap of logic. It's simply a
 case of reducing the set of numbers that we use, 0 through 9, down to 
its first two members.&nbsp; For bases greater than 10, letters of the alphabet can be used to represent digits greater than 9. One such system is hexadecimal, which is used fairly often with computers, and makes use of the number 0-9, and letters A-F. It is much easier to grasp by simply using this interactive demo:<br><br>

 &nbsp;The 16 bits are determined either by casting a divining chain or by 
repeatedly taking nuts from a pile and noting the remainder.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The resulting 16-bit string is used to find appropriate prayers and answers within the ritual.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These historical systems are all methods for breaking down the chaos of chance into a finite set of possibilities.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;By assigning meaning to these possibilities, people derive guidance and spiritual comfort.<br><br>Binary Fractals<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A binary fractal is a bitmap where white represents 1 and black represents 0.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This 2D bitmap is generated from a single 1-dimensional binary string.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The base pattern of the 1D string is encoded throughout the entire bitmap.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, the first row of the fractal for 4 (100) is 1-0-0.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The first row of the bitmap is identical to the first column.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Each subsequent row is either the original base string or its binary complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The determination of whether a row is the original or its complement depends on the corresponding bit in the first column.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The resulting 3x3 bitmap for 4 (100) consists of rows 1-0-0, 0-1-1, and 0-1-1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The "fractal" aspect arises from tiling the base bitmap 2x2 and overlaying a 2x scaled copy using boolean operations.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This process of tiling, scaling, and overlaying can be repeated infinitely to create higher "orders" of complexity.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The base bitmap with no self-interference is called a "first-order" binary fractal.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Further complexity is created when a different binary string interferes with the base fractal.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Interference patterns can also be generated by rotating two fractals as they overlay.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These rotational interferences create "zones" of repeating patterns whose size depends on the angle.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;An angle of 180/π degrees produces a zone that is 1 pixel wide.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The required angle for a specific zone size is (180/π) divided by the desired size.<br><br>Projection onto a "Bipolar" Sphere<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The first-order fractal patterns have a unique topology.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The top-left corner acts as one pole, and the bottom-right corner acts as the opposite pole.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The top-left pole radiates the base pattern horizontally and vertically.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The bottom-right pole radiates the reverse of the base string's complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The fractal inherently encodes the base string, its complement, its reverse, and its reverse-complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation transforms the base string into its complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A 90-degree clockwise rotation transforms the base string into its reverse.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A 180-degree rotation transforms the base string into its reverse-complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The diagonal lines of the fractal can be mapped as "latitude bands" on a sphere.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The number of diagonal latitude bands is equal to (2 · width) - 1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This method allows a 1D string to be projected as information onto a 2D spherical surface.<br><br>Binary Taxonomy (The Four Number Types)<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Integers and their corresponding fractals can be classified into distinct types based on their binary symmetry.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The primary categories are Monolateral, Bilateral, and Quadrilateral.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A number is Monolateral if its binary form is a palindrome, and all Monolaterals are odd.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Odd Bilateral category includes all odd numbers that are not palindromes.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Odd Bilateral numbers always exist in pairs, where one is the exact binary reverse of the other.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Even Bilateral numbers are generated by the Reverse Complement Concatenation (RCC) operation.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The RCC formula is N = S1 + ¬(~ S1), where S1 is a k-bit string and + is concatenation.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Even Bilateral numbers produced by RCC always have an even bit-length (2k).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Quadrilateral category contains all numbers that are not Monolateral or Bilateral.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;All Quadrilateral numbers are even.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A "trilateral" type is impossible in this system due to the inherent symmetries of the square bitmap.<br><br>The "Binary Grammar" (The Toolbox)<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A "Binary Grammar" describes the generation of these number types through a set of operations on a binary string `S`.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The three core Actions are: Replace (`→`), Append (`+`), and Prepend (`+`).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The three core Operations are: Identity (`I`), Invert (`¬`), and Reverse (`~`).<br>*&nbsp;
 &nbsp;The notation `[OPERATION] S + [OPERATION] S` defines the sequence, 
where the left side is prepended and the right side is appended.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Reverse-Replace operation `S → ~ S` defines the pairing rule for Odd Bilaterals.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Reverse-Append `S + ~ S` and Reverse-Prepend `~ S + S` operations are generators for Monolaterals.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Identity-Append operation `S + I S` generates "Tandem Palindromes," a sub-class of Even Bilaterals.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Invert-Append operation `S + ¬ S` generates "Contra-Palindromes," another sub-class of Even Bilaterals.<br><br>Population Dynamics (The Ecology)<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Population dynamics describe the distribution and first appearance of these number types across the number line.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Specific equations describe the proportion (percentage) of each type as the sample size (x) increases.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of Quadrilaterals is given by P_q(x) = C - (A / x^D) · cos(π · log₂(x)).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of Bilaterals is given by P_b(x) = C + (A / x^D) · cos(π · log₂(x)).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of Monolaterals is P_m(x) = 100 - (P_q(x) + P_b(x)).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportions of Bilaterals and Quadrilaterals converge at even powers of two (4, 16, 64).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;They reach maximum divergence at odd powers of two (8, 32, 128).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;As the sample size approaches infinity, the proportions of Monolaterals and Even Bilaterals approach 0%.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;As the sample size approaches infinity, Odd Bilaterals and Quadrilaterals each approach 50% of the total population.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;"Lag" equations describe the gap after a power of two (2^k) before the first new number of a specific type appears.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The lag for the first Monolateral (Standard Palindrome) after 2^k is always 1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The lag for the first Even Bilateral (RCC number) in a 2k-bit range is 2^k - 2.<br><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>
