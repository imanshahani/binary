The\nuniverse is filled, to the brim, with both apparent and true opposites. Through\nobservation, human beings have naturally come to describe the world in terms of\nopposites: light-dark, hot-cold, big-small, far-near, good-bad, pleasure-pain,\nday-night, summer-winter, future-past, and the list is seemingly endless. It is\nthus no surprise that numerous cultures around the world have innovated the use\nof binary for their own purposes. The most prominent among these would be\nGeomancy from the medieval Muslim world, and I-Ching from ancient China. Both\nare binary systems that are used to interpret and to predict outcomes from\nchance or chaos. Although these cultures did not necessarily view these systems\nas binary or computational, they can nevertheless be understood as such from\nour perspective in the 21<sup>st</sup> century."

This gives 16 derived bits, which are then\ndistributed to four groups that constitute “mothers”. Then four “daughters” are\nderived from a transposition of the first, second, third, and fourth bits of\nthe mothers.

His work is where binary\n notation with zeros and ones originates from. Of course, using zeros \nand ones to represent base-2 is not a crazy leap of logic. It's simply a\n case of reducing the set of numbers that we use, 0 through 9, down to \nits first two members.&nbsp; For bases greater than 10, letters of the alphabet can be used to represent digits greater than 9. One such system is hexadecimal, which is used fairly often with computers, and makes use of the number 0-9, and letters A-F.

    "content": "<p>Binary Systems in the Human Past<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Binary systems feel natural to human interpretation of the world.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The universe presents many apparent and true opposites.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Humans naturally describe the world using opposing pairs like light-dark, hot-cold, and good-bad.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Consequently, many cultures have independently developed binary systems for their own purposes.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Prominent historical examples include Geomancy from the medieval Muslim world and I-Ching from ancient China.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Both I-Ching and Geomancy are binary systems used to interpret and predict outcomes from random processes.<br><br>I-Ching<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The I-Ching is a 6-bit binary system from ancient China.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The system uses chance actions, like coin flips, to determine a sequence of two opposing states, creating a binary string.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The I-Ching assigns a unique identity and interpretation to each of its 64 possible outcomes, known as hexagrams.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These 64 6-bit hexagrams can be broken down into combinations of 8 possible 3-bit trigrams.<br><br>Geomancy<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Geomancy is a 4-bit binary system from the medieval Muslim world.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The process begins by creating 16 lines of random dots while considering a specific question.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Each line is interpreted as even (0) or odd (1) based on its dot count.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These 16 bits are arranged into four 4-bit groups called the \"mothers.\"<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Four \"daughters\" are derived by transposing the bits of the \"mothers.\"<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Four \"nieces\" are created by performing a binary XOR operation on pairs of \"mothers\" and \"daughters.\"<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Two \"witnesses\" are created by performing an XOR operation on pairs of \"nieces.\"<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A final \"judge\" is created by performing an XOR operation on the two \"witnesses\" and is used to interpret the matter.<br><br>Ifá<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Ifá is a 16-bit binary system from the Yoruba culture in western Africa.<br>*&nbsp;\n &nbsp;The 16 bits are determined either by casting a divining chain or by \nrepeatedly taking nuts from a pile and noting the remainder.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The resulting 16-bit string is used to find appropriate prayers and answers within the ritual.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These historical systems are all methods for breaking down the chaos of chance into a finite set of possibilities.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;By assigning meaning to these possibilities, people derive guidance and spiritual comfort.<br><br>Binary Fractals<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A binary fractal is a bitmap where white represents 1 and black represents 0.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This 2D bitmap is generated from a single 1-dimensional binary string.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The base pattern of the 1D string is encoded throughout the entire bitmap.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, the first row of the fractal for 4 (100) is 1-0-0.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The first row of the bitmap is identical to the first column.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Each subsequent row is either the original base string or its binary complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The determination of whether a row is the original or its complement depends on the corresponding bit in the first column.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The resulting 3x3 bitmap for 4 (100) consists of rows 1-0-0, 0-1-1, and 0-1-1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The \"fractal\" aspect arises from tiling the base bitmap 2x2 and overlaying a 2x scaled copy using boolean operations.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This process of tiling, scaling, and overlaying can be repeated infinitely to create higher \"orders\" of complexity.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The base bitmap with no self-interference is called a \"first-order\" binary fractal.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Further complexity is created when a different binary string interferes with the base fractal.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Interference patterns can also be generated by rotating two fractals as they overlay.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;These rotational interferences create \"zones\" of repeating patterns whose size depends on the angle.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;An angle of 180/π degrees produces a zone that is 1 pixel wide.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The required angle for a specific zone size is (180/π) divided by the desired size.<br><br>Projection onto a \"Bipolar\" Sphere<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The first-order fractal patterns have a unique topology.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The top-left corner acts as one pole, and the bottom-right corner acts as the opposite pole.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The top-left pole radiates the base pattern horizontally and vertically.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The bottom-right pole radiates the reverse of the base string's complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The fractal inherently encodes the base string, its complement, its reverse, and its reverse-complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation transforms the base string into its complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A 90-degree clockwise rotation transforms the base string into its reverse.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A 180-degree rotation transforms the base string into its reverse-complement.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The diagonal lines of the fractal can be mapped as \"latitude bands\" on a sphere.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The number of diagonal latitude bands is equal to (2 · width) - 1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This method allows a 1D string to be projected as information onto a 2D spherical surface.<br><br>Binary Taxonomy (The Four Number Types)<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Integers and their corresponding fractals can be classified into distinct types based on their binary symmetry.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The primary categories are Monolateral, Bilateral, and Quadrilateral.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A number is Monolateral if its binary form is a palindrome, and all Monolaterals are odd.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Odd Bilateral category includes all odd numbers that are not palindromes.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Odd Bilateral numbers always exist in pairs, where one is the exact binary reverse of the other.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Even Bilateral numbers are generated by the Reverse Complement Concatenation (RCC) operation.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The RCC formula is N = S1 + ¬(~ S1), where S1 is a k-bit string and + is concatenation.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Even Bilateral numbers produced by RCC always have an even bit-length (2k).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Quadrilateral category contains all numbers that are not Monolateral or Bilateral.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;All Quadrilateral numbers are even.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A \"trilateral\" type is impossible in this system due to the inherent symmetries of the square bitmap.<br><br>The \"Binary Grammar\" (The Toolbox)<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A \"Binary Grammar\" describes the generation of these number types through a set of operations on a binary string `S`.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The three core Actions are: Replace (`→`), Append (`+`), and Prepend (`+`).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The three core Operations are: Identity (`I`), Invert (`¬`), and Reverse (`~`).<br>*&nbsp;\n &nbsp;The notation `[OPERATION] S + [OPERATION] S` defines the sequence, \nwhere the left side is prepended and the right side is appended.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Reverse-Replace operation `S → ~ S` defines the pairing rule for Odd Bilaterals.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Reverse-Append `S + ~ S` and Reverse-Prepend `~ S + S` operations are generators for Monolaterals.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Identity-Append operation `S + I S` generates \"Tandem Palindromes,\" a sub-class of Even Bilaterals.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The Invert-Append operation `S + ¬ S` generates \"Contra-Palindromes,\" another sub-class of Even Bilaterals.<br><br>Population Dynamics (The Ecology)<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Population dynamics describe the distribution and first appearance of these number types across the number line.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Specific equations describe the proportion (percentage) of each type as the sample size (x) increases.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of Quadrilaterals is given by P_q(x) = C - (A / x^D) · cos(π · log₂(x)).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of Bilaterals is given by P_b(x) = C + (A / x^D) · cos(π · log₂(x)).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportion of Monolaterals is P_m(x) = 100 - (P_q(x) + P_b(x)).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The proportions of Bilaterals and Quadrilaterals converge at even powers of two (4, 16, 64).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;They reach maximum divergence at odd powers of two (8, 32, 128).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;As the sample size approaches infinity, the proportions of Monolaterals and Even Bilaterals approach 0%.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;As the sample size approaches infinity, Odd Bilaterals and Quadrilaterals each approach 50% of the total population.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Lag\" equations describe the gap after a power of two (2^k) before the first new number of a specific type appears.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The lag for the first Monolateral (Standard Palindrome) after 2^k is always 1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The lag for the first Even Bilateral (RCC number) in a 2k-bit range is 2^k - 2.<br><br>Quadrilateral Unified Theory<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A \"Trunk\" or Universal Law governs 100% of all Quadrilateral families.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This \"Balance Law\" states that for a family (a, b, c, d), the diagonal sums must be equal: a+d = b+c.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Branches\" are collections of families that share the same Universal Sum (a+d).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This Universal Sum (S) is always a Mersenne Number of the form S = 2^p - 1.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Leaves\" are specific, \"elegant\" traits that describe the internal relationships between a family's members.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;One leaf system involves multiplicative pairs, which are always paired with a hidden leaf by the Trunk Law.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;For the b = k · a law, the hidden complementary law is d-c = (k-1) · a.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;For the c = (2^p) · a law, the hidden complementary law is d-b = (2^p - 1) · a.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A second leaf system shows families are generated by the two roots of a simple quadratic equation.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Form A families appear to follow b = 2a + m but are truly generated by m = 1 ± (3 · 2^p).<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;Form B families appear to follow b = 4a + m but are truly generated by m = (S ± 2^p) / 2.<br>*&nbsp;\n &nbsp;The \"Delta-D\" (ΔD) structure proves that the numerous \"Lone Wolf\" \nAdditive families (where b = a+D) are also highly structured.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The smallest, most fundamental D families follow a geometric sequence D = 6 · 2^k.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The largest D families are generated by the simplest factorization of the Delta (ΔD), represented as D = S - K · X.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;In this formula, S is the Mersenne Branch Sum, K is its simplest prime factor, and X is a structured sequence.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;A \"Binary Constraint Rule\" governs the behavior of the sequence X.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;The sequence X advances in steps (ΔX) that are powers of two.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This step size (ΔX) halves whenever X becomes a multiple of another significant prime factor of S.<br>*&nbsp; &nbsp;This halving is caused by the new factor imposing a binary periodicity constraint on the calculation.</p>"
